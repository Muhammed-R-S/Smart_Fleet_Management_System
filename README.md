# Smart_Fleet_Management_System
Welcome to the Smart Fleet Management System repository! This project aims to provide an intelligent solution for managing a fleet of vehicles, tracking their status, maintenance schedules, and optimizing operations. The system is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Project Structure
The project is organized into two sub-folders:

Frontend - Located in the /Frontend folder
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this part of the system provides a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor the fleet. It includes features for viewing vehicle status, scheduling maintenance, and managing fleet operations.
Backend - Located in the /Backend folder
Developed in Python, the backend is responsible for generating sample data, handling data processing, storage, and providing the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with. It uses an SQLite database to store information about the fleet, vehicles, maintenance schedules, and more.
